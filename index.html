    <p>
      What is a Cricut Machine? A Cricut is an electronic cutting machine that
      can cut all sorts of designs from materials like paper, vinyl, card stock,
      and iron-on transfers. Some Cricut machines can even cut leather and wood!
      You can use the Cricut to cut just about anything you would typically cut
      with scissors or an X-acto knife. That said, a Cricut can cut with much
      more precision and speed than would ever be achievable by hand!
